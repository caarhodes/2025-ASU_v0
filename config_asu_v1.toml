# The config file is specified by one of the following. If multiple options are available, the first is used:
# 1. Run the app with `streamlit run first_prototype.py path-to-file/config-file-name.toml`
# 2. Add the line `CONFIG_FILE = 'path-to-file/config-file-name.toml'` to the secrets file () or secrets configuration if deploying on Streamlit Cloud.
#   Run the app with `streamlit run first_prototype.py`.
# 3. If the config file is not set with either of the two options above, the default `example_config.toml` file is used.

scenario = """
I've been trying to get the hang of using 'time out' as a parenting tool. To practice, I started with my husband, using a script to guide me. At first, it went well—I was able to repeat the directions and send him to 'time out.' But then he got bored and left, so I had to switch to practicing with a teddy bear. While I could still practice the steps, the teddy bear didn't talk back, so I missed out on experiencing how a real child might react, especially if they refuse to go to time out or get upset about losing a privilege. I'm curious about how to handle it if my child refuses to cooperate and what to do if they start screaming about losing their privilege.
